# Complexity; They are divided into Time Complexity and Space Complexity

## Constant Complexity O(1)

## Linear Complexity O(n)

## Quadratic Complexity O(n^2)

## Exponential Complexity

- This is denoted by O(c^n) ; where c can be constants denoting the number of loops

## Logarithmic Complexity

- This is denoted by O(log n)
- Used to make most efficient and fast algorithms
- Time is decreased at a magnitude inversely propotional to N
